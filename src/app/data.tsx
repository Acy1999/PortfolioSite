The application provides a clean, responsive interface where two players can take turns marking Xs and Os on a 3x3 grid. The logic behind the game, including turn management, win condition checks, and draw detection, is handled entirely through JavaScript. The DOM is manipulated directly to update the board and display the current game status, making the experience feel smooth and interactive without relying on any additional tools or dependencies.",

The layout is fully responsive, adapting well to different screen sizes, including mobile devices. This app showcases the power and flexibility of core web technologies and serves as a great demonstration of how a polished, interactive web application can be built from scratch using only the essentials of front-end development.",
